# TrailAnywhere

## Introduction

TrailAnywhere is an app to help users search for hiking trails. Using a zip code, longitude/latitude coordinates, difficulty rating, or
type of trail, the app will search for a list of trails that fall within the given user input.

Other features will include adding new trails, adding alerts to a trail, like Waze app alerts, and seeing what the current weather report is based on a 
trails zip code. 

Because TrailAnywhere is a microservice, users can interact with this application using either a set of RESTFul service endpoints, a simple UI, or both.

## Requirements

### 1. Hikers would like the ability to search for information about hiking trails.

### Example

**Given**: Trail data is available and there are 2 trails rated “Difficult”

**When**: The user searches for trails with the constraint “Difficult”

**Then**: TrailAnywhere returns 2 hiking trails, rated “Difficult”

### Example

**Given**: Trail data is available

**When**: The User searches “Bajs784jds” in the trail field

**Then**: TrailAnywhere does not return results

### Example

**Given**: Trail data is available and has a "Forrest Park" entry

**When**: The user searches for “Forest Park”

**Then**: TrailAnywhere returns information/attributes for “Forest Park”

### Example

**Given**: Trail data is available, “Mount Airy” is the only trail in the zip code 45239

**When**: The User enters “45239” in the zip code field

**Then**: TrailAnywhere returns one trail, “Mount Airy”

### 2.	Hikers would like to know about weather details for trails found based on search parameters.

### Example

**Given**: Trail data is available with a zip code attribute

**When**: User enters in information to find a trail based on zip code, 45239

**Then**: Weather information is provided below the trail results for area in zip code 45239

### Example

**Given**: Trail data is available with a longitude/latitude attribute

**When**: User enters in information to find a trail based on longitude/latitude 39.19937,-84.57534

**Then**: A service will convert the longitude/latitude to a zip code

**Then**: Weather information will be provided based on the zip code, 45239

### 3.  Hikers would like to search for and add alerts relating to specific trails.

### Example

**Given**: UserA is logged in, and trail “Sharon Woods” data is available

**When**: UserA submits an alert for “Flooding” along the “Sharon Woods” trail

**Then**: TrailAnywhere adds UserA’s “Flooding” alert to “Sharon Woods”.

**Then**: TrailAnywhere displays “Flooding” alert to other users looking for “Sharon Woods”

#### Example

**Given**: UserB is logged in, and trail “French Park” data is available

**When**: UserB submits an alert that contains bad language for trail “French Park”

**Then**: The TrailAnywhere app will show an error prompt saying "No profane language is allowed for trail alerts!," when UserB hits the submit button.
